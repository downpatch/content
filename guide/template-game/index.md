# Template Game!

This page is a copy/paste template for new game pages on downpatch.com.  
It focuses on **timing**, **version rules**, and **basic tooling**, not routing or advanced strategies.

Replace anything marked **REPLACE_ME** or that contains “example”.

## Leaderboards

The main leaderboard for Template Game! is on speedrun.com:

- https://www.speedrun.com/REPLACE_ME

Always read the category rules before attempting or submitting runs, especially around timing and allowed versions.

## Do I need to downpatch?

**Sometimes.**

Describe the situations where downpatching is required:

- **PC (Steam):** Often required for categories impacted by patches or physics changes
- **PC (Microsoft Store):** Usually cannot downpatch; may be restricted for some categories
- **Console:** Typically latest version only (no downpatching)

If you’re unsure, check the specific category rules on speedrun.com.

For instructions, see:
- Downpatching guide: https://downpatch.com/guide/downpatch

Template Game! uses **RTA (Real Time Attack)**.
