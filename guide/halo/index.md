# Halo: The Master Chief Collection

Halo: The Master Chief Collection (MCC) contains multiple Halo games under one launcher, but in speedrunning terms it is **not treated as a single game**.

Each Halo title inside MCC has its own categories, rules, and timing expectations. This page explains how Halo speedrunning is structured at a high level, and how the individual game pages fit into that.

---

## Where the rules and leaderboards live

Halo speedrunning uses **[haloruns.com](haloruns.com)** for:
- rules
- category definitions
- timing requirements
- leaderboard submissions

That site is where decisions are made and where official information lives.  
If there is ever a difference between what’s written here and what’s on haloruns, the haloruns rules take priority.

## How MCC is treated in speedrunning

Even though MCC is a single collection, runs are organised by **individual game**, not by the collection as a whole.

The MCC titles commonly run are:
- Halo: Combat Evolved
- Halo 2
- Halo 3
- Halo 3: ODST
- Halo: Reach
- Halo 4

Each of these games:
- has its own categories
- may use different timing methods
- may have different version or setting expectations

---

## Timing methods

There is no single timing method that applies to all MCC games.

Depending on the game and category, runs may use:
- In-game time
- Theatre time
- RTA - loads

All of this is defined on haloruns and enforced per game.  
The sub-pages here focus on summarising what you actually need to set up for that specific game before running.

---

## Versions and downpatching

Version behaviour matters for some Halo runs.

Some games and categories are fine on the latest MCC version. Others rely on older behaviour, which can mean:
- specific game versions
- avoiding certain updates
- downpatching on PC

This is not universal across MCC. Whether it matters depends on the game and category.  
Individual game pages will call this out where relevant.

There is also a tool to help you downpatch located here: [https://halo.downpatch.com](https://halo.downpatch.com)
