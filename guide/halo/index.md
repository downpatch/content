# Halo: The Master Chief Collection

MCC is one launcher, but speedrunning is organised per game. Use the links below to jump straight to the game you want.

## Official rules and leaderboards
- Rules and categories live on https://haloruns.com/rules  
- If anything here disagrees with Haloruns, follow Haloruns.

## Choose a game
- [Halo: Combat Evolved](haloce/)
- [Halo 2](halo2/)
- [Halo 3](halo3/)
- [Halo 3: ODST](halo3odst/)
- [Halo: Reach](haloreach/)
- [Halo 4](halo4/)

## Before you start
These will become separate standard pages (so the game pages stay short):
- LiveSplit setup (timer, layout, splits)
- Capture/recording basics (what to record, audio, proof)
- Timing method overview (RTA / IGT / Theatre, per-game differences)
- Versions and downpatching (only matters for some categories)

## Downpatch tool (PC)
If your category needs an older version, use: https://halo.downpatch.com
