**Quarantine Zone** (often abbreviated **QZ**) is the tenth playable level in [Halo 2](../../index.md). See Quarantine Zone (level) for general information.

## Easy

Immediately grab the ghost that spawns to your left. Progress through the level in the ghost. There are a few shortcuts that you can do, and at the part that you would assume you have to get out of the ghost you can still take the ghost with some good driving. I recommend watching the IL video to learn the path.

The gondola is an auto-scroller. At the end you can sword fly off of a flood to skip a bit of walking. Alternatively just complete the level normally.
