## Start & Gap Jump

### *Easy*

Progress through the level normally until you reach the bridge with the ghosts. You can do the normal strategy of pressing the button or do a grenade jump in the Ghost to get across the gap. Drive towards the gap. Throw a grenade at the edge and immediately get in your Ghost, then full boost towards the grenade. The grenade should explode under the back half of the ghost while you're at full speed. If you've done everything right, you'll launch yourself across the gap. This is better viewed with a tutorial: [Gap Jump Tutorial](https://youtu.be/L9rGQ_8hOrs?t=9342). Experiment with this trick and tune it to how you like! This trick will take practice to become consistent at.

### *Legendary*

At the start of the level, switch to your rocket launcher and hop on the rock directly to your left. Shoot a rocket at the ground in front of you, and then very quickly afterwards jump. This will boost you onto the rock shelf above you, saving time. Shoot your second rocket at the turret on your right while continuing to move forward. Jump in the small gap between the rock ahead of you and the wall. Grab the BR on the ground next to the ODST Drop Pod and shoot the wall directly above the ramp into the Forerunner ruins. This will bait the Jackal sniper out into the open, where you can headshot him. This start may seem scary and dangerous at first, but it's very consistent once you master it. Continue onwards until you hit a mandatory trigger in the next section. *Do not go far enough so that you can see the jackal snipers that spawn in the next area. If you see snipers, you've gone too far.* After hitting this trigger, backtrack while tightly hugging the left wall. After following this wall for a way, you will hit a point where you can jump out-of-bounds. Do so and walk towards the next area where you take the Ghost. If a turret appears on the structure to your front-right, shoot it with a rocket. Use your second rocket on the left-side Ghost and take the right-side Ghost. Proceed to the Gap Jump like normal. This start is best visualized with a video showing you exactly where to go and how far: [Legendary Start + Gap Jump Example](https://youtu.be/wwruL5ea5KM?t=6159).

## Post-Gap Jump

### *Easy*

After Gap Jump, drive through the Forerunner structures like normal. Once you reach the open area (after the "You Break It, You Buy It" chapter title) drive through all the enemies like normal. Once you reach the downward ramp, drive onto it, then backtrack. Backtrack to your left until you reach a low, sloped wall on the left side. Drive up this wall, holding the nose of your Ghost in the air to make this easier. Climb the next wall as well. Drive onto the long, sloped wall you see, following the bushes. Drive along this sloped wall until you it ends. Drop off the wall onto the floor below, taking care to not fall timer and die. This section is difficult to describe in writing; it is best visualized using a video: [Delta Halo Easy Driving](https://youtu.be/K860Q3LZBMM?t=1591).

### *Legendary*

The Legendary driving is a little different than Easy. After Gap Jump, drive just inside the Forerunner structure, then backtrack. This hits a mandatory trigger that is required to end the level. Backtrack out of the Forerunner structure towards the far wall, to the left of the huge tree and close to the edge. Climb this wall with your Ghost and keep climbing until you're on top of the mountain. Follow the mountain down, towards the square gap in the textures (visible on classic graphics). Go to the right of this patch and drop off the ledge. This will drop you into the combat zone, but with no enemy spawns. The rest of the driving is the same as on Easy. Once again, this driving is best visualized with a video example to follow: [Delta Halo Legendary Driving](https://youtu.be/wwruL5ea5KM?t=6242).

## Grotto Drop

### *Easy and Legendary*

This section plays the same on Easy and Legendary. You want to be faster on Legendary since the snipers can actually kill you. After dropping off the wall, drive towards the square shelf to the left of that big pillar. Sit on it and line yourself up with the long, rectangular shelf beneath you. Drive off the square shelf and safely land on the slope beneath you. This next part is crucial: line yourself up with the pillar, and slowly drop into the trigger volume below you. Feather your boost while you're falling to ensure that you don't drop into the grotto. Once you see the title card "Off The Rock, Through The Bush, Nothing But Jackal" you've successfully hit the trigger. Slam your boost and drive back up the wall. On Legendary you need to be quick or the snipers will get you. Next, drive along the edge of the grotto towards the large structure on the edge of the lake. A video example of this is very helpful: [Grotto Drop Example](https://youtu.be/wwruL5ea5KM?t=6313)

## Ending

### *Easy*

Drive down the ramp towards the door. Jump out and move to the right inside of the door. Shoot a rocket directly at the Plasma Rifle-wielding Elite, then jump onto the ledge on your right. After jumping onto this ledge, shoot the Plasma Rifle Elite again to kill him, then BR the remaining Elite. If another Elite spawns next to you, kill him. *If you are doing downpatched full game runs, exchange your BR for the Energy Sword. If you are doing fullgame runs on current patch, exchange your Rocket Launcher for the Energy Sword.*

### *Legendary*

Before driving down the ramp, stop and exchange your BR for a Plasma Pistol. Drive into the door and move to the right while simultaneously charging your Plasma Pistol. Once you can see the Elites, overcharge the Plasma Rifle wielding Elite and jump on the ledge to your right. After jumping onto this ledge, rocket the Plasma Rifle Elite to kill him. If another Elite spawns next to you, kill him with an overcharge Plasma Pistol shot + Rocket Launcher melee. Then, kill the Energy Sword Elite to end the level. *If you are doing downpatched full game runs, exchange your BR for the Energy Sword. If you are doing fullgame runs on current patch, exchange your Rocket Launcher for the Energy Sword.*
