## Easy

### Beach Fight

\- The Beach fight is heavily optimized. The current world record has roughly a 30 second clear, but faster is possible. When killing the first wave of enemies, it is important not to kill too many of them too early. The trigger for spawning the next wave of enemies is tied to the number of enemies killed in the first wave. Charge up your spartan Laser and try to kill the second wave of enemies right as they spawn. Then turn your attention to the left hand turret and throw a grenade at it, right after throwing a grenade, charge up your laser and kill the AA wraith, then go right and kill the second turret, move forward and clean up the remaining enemies. Once you get the "Beach Secure", grab the fresh spartan laser from the front of the crashed pelican and make sure you also pick up the fuel rod cannon and as many grenades as you can from the dead bodies.

### First Tower Approach

Take the warthog, as it has a higher top-speed than the mongoose. Avoid running into the ghosts on the way up and when you get to the top of the cliff, cut left immediately and get some sick air off the cliff. Make a bee-line straight for the entrance to the Tower, but slow down just slightly before you get to the narrow hallway and hang slightly to the right. Let the two Brute choppers make their way out of the hallway before charging in there with your warthog. Splatter the turret and get out and make your way through the doors into the Tower.

### First Tower Interior

Proceed through the door and choose one of two main routes:

**Route 1 (fastest)**: Run forwards and jump onto the covenant ammo crates in the middle of the room, then fuel rod jump up onto the elevator platform.

**Route 2**: after the entrance hallway, cut left and jump onto the support beam, then up through the window onto the second floor, then jump to the elevator. You can also use this to pick up the power drain if you feel so inclined.

once you press the elevator button, fuel rod jump up and into the beam of light. There is an invisible platform here to stand on that will help you get to the top of the elevator ever so slightly earlier. Charge up your laser and try to hit the chieftain and one other brute with the laser before they've finished their animation sequence, then just clean up the brutes, hit the button, make your way back down the elevator, and try not to die while making your way back out to your warthog. Sometimes the warthog despawns. If it has, just run up the ramp to outside and the marines should have brought you a nice warthog. Make your way back to the beach.

### Hornet Section And Third Tower

once at the beach, take a Hornet and make a bee-line for the sea cliffs in the distance. You'll go around the cliffs and come upon the third tower. Drop out of the Hornet into the Right hand side tower entrance and laser the brutes coming out. Once inside the tower, avoid the middle area, as hunters are about to show up. Instead, cut left and use the gravity hammer to jump up to the second level where you can then walk onto the platform and press the button.

Charge up your laser as the lift nears the top floor. Kill all brutes as fast as possible, press the button, and make your way back down the lift. Back on the ground floor, you can use the covenant ammo crates on either side of the entrance area to box launch towards the door, but you may sometimes be overpowered and die from hitting the large glass wall or the back wall of the tower.
