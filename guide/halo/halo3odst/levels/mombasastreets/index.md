Mombasa Streets is the hub world in [Halo 3: ODST](../../index.md). See [Halopedia](http://www.halopedia.org/Mombasa_Streets) for general information.

The full rough path for Mombasa Streets on easy can be found in the link below. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D26t2cFEdwo&feature=youtu.be>

# Full Game Mombasa Streets Routing

## Easy Streets Carryover

(Roughly what this WR does <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B_FES8hqOI>)

- Use nades in PtD for clears and for speed. Empty SMG/Automag for fresh loadout.
- Use nades in MS1 for speed, hope the 1st two grunts give you at least one Plasma Pistol to try and get a beserking brute. (Haven't seen a good way to get a beserking brute by using a needler). Empty SMG/Automag for fresh loadout.
- Use nades in MS2 for speed (I think if grunt on middle turret has a Plasma Pistol you can try grabbing it to get a beserking brute in that area). Empty SMG/Automag for fresh loadout.
- Use nades in MS3 to get to the gauss turret, try and pick up nades at the end so you have at least 2. Don't empty SMG/Automag.
- Use 1 frag in MS4 for a slide boost at the start. Don't empty SMG/Automag.
- No nades usage in MS5, just drive. Don't empty SMG/Automag.
- No nade usage in MS6, just drive. Don't empty SMG/Automag.
- Enter DH with 1 frag and collect 2 more right at the start.

## Legendary Streets Carryover

Optimally it would be best to do the easy route above but MS2 can be a bit tough with that route. Alternative strats for the above include:

- If you get a Plasma Pistol drop from the 1st two grunts, use 2 frags in MS2 for speed. Don't empty SMG/Automag.
- In MS2 don't grab sniper and go straight through the mission with double pistol, 1 frag and maybe some lucky plasmas. Collect frags by the goose, keep them and don't empty SMG/Automag or use them for combat and do empty Sniper/Automag (either way doesn't matter too much if you walk up the stairs in MS3 and then collect nades by the gauss turret.)

OR (roughly what this WR does <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-B4ahV3NxM>)

- With a fresh loadout in MS2, grab sniper and frags (use 1-2 frags to get to the goose cache quickly). Grab frags in goose cache, keep them and don't empty Sniper/Automag or use them for combat and do empty Sniper/Automag (either way doesn't matter too much if you walk up the stairs in MS3 and then collect nades by the gauss turret.)

OR even safer

- With a fresh loadout in MS2, grab the sniper and frags and head in the other direction (to the right of the supply cache when facing the doors from outside the cache). Kill any jackals or grunts that are of danger to you. Before you get to the intersection down the road turn left into the building, these is a room with plasma coils and 2 flame nades. Collect the flame nades and exit out the other side of the building. Head left up the road to exit through the big doors and continue down the normal route.

OR even safer (overkill in terms of safety)

- In PtD use frags for first enemy clears and then collect as many plasma and spike grenades as possible. Run through grunt courtyard to the end of the mission without using nades. Don't empty SMG/Automag, ensure you don't have an empty UNSC weapon, this ensures carryover.
- In MS1 don't use nades for movement, simply walk to the end of the mission.
- In MS2 do the above route and grab the sniper and a fresh Automag and then go collect the flame nades.

A mixture of all of the above strategies can work.
