As a speedgame, Halo 3: ODST is not as popular as the others in the series. Levels tend to be linear and there is a lot of walking between levels. Halo 3: ODST uses the same engine as [Halo 3](../halo3/index.md), meaning that many Halo 3 tricks should be equally possible in ODST. However, tricks which rely on equipment are not possible, as enemies do not drop equipment.

In Halo 3: ODST full game speedruns, you start on Prepare To Drop, and you are allowed to use a profile that has the audio logs unlocked. Runs on the original copy of Halo 3: ODST (including running on the backwards compatible version through Xbox One) are timed by adding up the times of the theater clips for each level. Because the Master Chief Collection cannot store all of the theater films for a complete run of the game, full game runs are timed on MCC as RTA minus loads. Individual level (IL) runs are timed using the time displayed in the post-game carnage report.

## Audio Logs

Unlocking 8 audio logs in Mombasa Streets will allow you to use Mongooses. See [this link](http://imgur.com/MucBAAm) for the locations of all audio logs in Mombasa Streets. Some will not be able to be unlocked until you progress through the game. Audio logs ready to be collected will glow yellow in the VISR.

## Version Differences

Halo 3: ODST originally released on the Xbox 360. The original game (OG) runs at 30 frames per second while the Master Chief Collection version of the game runs at 60 frames per second. As a result, there are several small differences between the original game and the MCC version. Enemies go through animations faster on the MCC version, meaning that Legendary can become more challenging due to the enemies' increased aggressiveness. In addition, it is easier to conserve momentum on MCC, which makes launches (such as with the gravity hammer) more powerful, allowing you to travel farther.

## Movement Techniques

### Grenade Propulsion

The explosive force from a grenade can be utilized to propel the player a direction. The most common use is a grenade jump, which is done by throwing a grenade at your feet and jumping as it explodes. This grants the player increased height, allowing them to reach areas that may be otherwise unreachable with a normal jump. In addition, grenades can also be used to grant a player extra forward momentum. Throwing a grenade so that it lands just behind you will propel you forward if you jump as the grenade explodes.

### Brute Shot / Fuel Rod Propulsion

Similar to grenade propulsion, the player can use a brute shot or a fuel rod gun to propel oneself upwards or forwards. To jump, aim at your feet and fire your brute shot or fuel rod gun at the ground below you while simultaneously jumping. This grants the player extra height. This technique can also be used to gain forward momentum by shooting the floor behind you while jumping.

### Slide Jumping

When landing from a jump onto a surface that is sloped downward, then proceeding to jump once you make contact with the surface, the player's downward momentum will be translated to forward momentum, allowing the player to move faster. The player can be boosted even farther if they uncrouch as they jump off the slope.
