Here's some of the things that need to be done on the wiki, all the help is appreciated! Please make a note of what you have done.  
  
Updating all pages to have complete and up-to-date trick information (as of Dec 2024). Use the following template as a starting point:  
Brief Explanation of the level, link to haloruns leaderboard  
Level Cutout: Time goals, notable dialogue quote, level image, level navigation  
Video Examples embedded in the first section.  
\* Next Sections should be breakouts of key portions of the level. EX from WC: Mission Start, Falcon Grab, Out of Bounds, Relay Outpost, Final Area  
Section dedicated to Co-op  
Potential Strategies and Knowledge Base Section. Example [ Here](haloreach/levels/wintercontingency/index.md)  
  
  
\*Add pages for Halo Infinite and Halo 5: Guardians

- Embed World Record Runs at the top of each level page
- Add better way of navigating between levels (e.g. forward/back through levels)
- Find and properly document old strategies
- Make pages for the Spin-off games
