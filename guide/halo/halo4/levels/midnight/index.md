**Midnight** is the eighth level in [Halo 4](../../index.md). See [Halopedia](http://www.halopedia.org/Midnight) for general information.

## Easy

**Pillar Grenade Jumps** - Use grenade jumps to skip the lower areas of the 2 towers by jumping on pillars to the top on the right side of tower starts (Video only shows one tower but it can be done at both). [Tutorial](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/2728703)

## Medium

**OOB Broadsword** - Using a hole in collision fly out of the map with broadsword and skip maze sequence, requires certain loadzones to fully skip. Watch Video: [Tutorial by Hoshka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nZp6pOFUtY) (Thx finally a good tutorial well explained for this)

## Hard

**Box launch to portal** - Using the Gravity Hammer, after picking Cortana up in Crawler room, use the box to launch to the portal. Can be inconsistent i.e. accidentally splatter yourself and may not be viable without Cowbell. [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37VWtQeQY_A&feature=youtu.be)
