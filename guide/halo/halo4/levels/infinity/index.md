## Easy

**1/4 Load Skip** - After first encounter with crawlers, DON'T LEAVE THE COVE! instead jump onto trees on left and jump across to skip loadzone that despawns all enemies in the first area. Used on Legendary. [Tutorial](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/3009596)

**Tank Load Skip** - As soon as the pelican drops you off run to the left and jump onto the branch/rock that hangs over the crashed ship, hug the wall and follow it till where the first floating platform would be but now the rest of the area will not spawn, continue forward to get a Ghost(Easy) or the Wraith(Legendary).
