## Mission Start

At mission start, you must run through rubble to get to a warthog. In the past, it was suggested to go for various slide jumps here to save an extra few seconds over muscle running. This is no longer the suggestion, and a good example of a muscle running route can be found [here](https://youtu.be/PHVOBGpMwlE?si=fqe3R5Gs7MWi2a1y).

- Note: If you are on Legendary and do not plan on performing ghost strats for Map Room, you can grab a [Fuel Rod or Plasma Pistol](https://youtu.be/Cck1bv_TlCg?si=vBopkPVcvMolSexk&t=9) (rng based on seed) for the camo clear.

### Hog Slide

There is one recommended slide jump approaching the flipped hog. While on top of the mini mountain, as you run [off the mountain](https://youtu.be/PHVOBGpMwlE?si=G2YGc7NXGowZZPON&t=43) and you touch the brown mud hill, you want to take one additional step before jumping towards the slanted rock. If performed correctly, you will get a small boost.

As a small preference, some runners (especially those on controller) find it difficult to flip the hog while entering. Shooting 4 shots of the magnum at the hog will cause it to flip upright.

## Driving

The drive lines to maintain optimal speed are quite precise, but not hard to learn by any means. The route that the current world record run does is sufficient. Some notes:

- If you tend to flip on a certain jump, try flicking your camera up/down. You can also pull the hand brake after your front tires leave the ramp.

## Ghost Grab

Once again, this part is pretty straight forward. On easy, you want to melee the ghost wings 3 times, 2 on one side, and 1 on the other. In order to not have to do 4 melees, aim your melees anywhere between the wing that attached to the body to the middle. Meleeing the tip of the wings will cause a 4 melee.

Note: You want to keep your wings for legendary.

When approaching the cliff, turn diagonally, lift the ghost nose (A button or CTRL), and flick to face straight forward as you begin to go over the rock cliff.

Legendary: Follow the Route on the legendary world record run. As you proceed through the rockway and get to the grunts, get out and shoot them.

## Camo Clear

## Map Room Clear

\- **Easy**: On easy difficulty the energy sword is carried into map room to aid the players movement. Normally when shot, the player is reduced to walking speed. But when the energy sword is being carried, the player loses no speed when shot at. The player will traverse the room from left to right on easy difficulty. Refer to Egg92's tutorial [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/135041846?t=00h10m40s).

\- **Legendary**: On the legendary difficulty the player carries the magnum and fuel rod into map room. The magnum will be replaced for the carbine when heading to the first generator on the right. The fuel rod can be replaced by the plasma pistol if the fuel rod is low on ammo or if the plasma pistol is preferred. Map room on legendary is done by moving from the right side of the room to the left side, the opposite of easy. For an tutorial refer [here](https://youtu.be/6DANcBnW4PA).

## Bridge Section

\- Bridge section is one of the most difficult sections in Requiem. On the easy difficulty, early banshee and the banshee out of bounds can be done. While on legendary, the player hugs the right side of the bridge and runs in a certain path to try and avoid death.

## Final Area

\- There are multiple ways to get through the final area of Requiem. If the banshee out of bounds is performed on bridge section, the player can fly the banshee to the final door and none of the enemies will load into that section. Other wise a series of concussion rifle jumps can be performed on the tower to get to the top faster and to skip a fight with the hunters. On both difficulties, the player should hijack a ghost and on easy the player goes straight to the spot to begin the concussion jumps (Player should have concussion rifle from previous bridge section). On legendary, the player drives the ghost into the back room and splatters the Elite carrying a concussion rifle. Going into the back room also despawns all of the enemies that are in the outside portion allowing the player to back track to the spot to perform the concussion rifle jumps.

## Potential Strategies and Knowledge Base

Throughout the development of this level, there have been many strat discoveries that have either been lost with time or have been proven too difficult to be executed consistently across runs. The following sections is for maintaining a list of potential developments that may be referenced for a future date, and will be listed with:

- Who discovered the trick, date of discovery, and various notes

#### Historical Strategies

- [Hog Route to Camo](https://youtu.be/vEl3T_bU5ww) Netjive8, Nov. 2017. Obsolete by Ghost Grab.

#### Potential Strategies

- [Camo Clear Ghost Jump](https://youtu.be/F-taVW_D2Lo?si=3SgcqByizsEaEhvj) Bliny, Jan. 2025. Difficult, but would save around 8 seconds.
- [Nading the Late Banshee Closer](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/780100934) ProAceJoker, Oct. 2020. Saves 5 seconds over current route (Apr. 2025), but would be slower than early banshee on legendary.

#### Knowledge Base

- [Clipping speed at Camo Clear](https://youtu.be/7oa5jJtwxoI) VyPr, Nov. 2022. No use, more for documentation purposes.
- [BOOL Clip back in bounds](https://youtu.be/CVxBgmY6_bA) Danza, Oct. 2018. This clip was the foundation for what is now known as Extended BOOL.
- [Backtracking Easter Egg](https://youtu.be/opJYyWN10Js) Kevin Gomez, Nov. 2012. No use in current route.
