**Shutdown** is the sixth level in [Halo 4](../../index.md). See [Halopedia](http://www.halopedia.org/Shutdown) for general information.

## Easy

**Level Skip** - After getting into the Pelican, fly all the way to the final area of the level(it is unmarked) and there is a hole in the door that can be jetpacked through to skip to the end of the level. [Tutorial](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/2728528)

## Hard

**Parallel Pillar Launch** - Top of the first lift, jump somewhat parallel to the scripted pillar and it will launch you to the final area, skipping all fights. Quite a lot of luck on this trick but a reference point can be used to get the trick somewhat consistent, takes lots of practice. [Tutorial](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/2290906)

## Not Working

**Shutdown control room OOB** - Using the banshee to get OOB by the door after that you can explore some areas no way found to the end trigger. [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N_ZOUeCqbs)
