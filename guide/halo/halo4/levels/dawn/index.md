## Mission Start

Note: This mission plays faster on the Master Chief Collection compared to the Xbox 360 version due to shorter load times, different enemy spawn locations, and altered enemy behavior.

After sitting in a cryo tube for 47 seconds, you gain control of chief and are able to start the mission. At the start, we want to use the  muscle running technique to maintain full sprint throughout the hallways.

**NOTE: At this point, you must decide if you would like to proceed with the beginner or advanced route, which will determine where you go out-of-bounds for the level. Dawn Super Skip (DSS) is very time consuming to learn and is considered an advanced trick, so skip to the Dawn Skip section if you are a beginner to intermediate runner.**

## Dawn Skip

Dawn Skip (initially performed by tricking group Termacious Trickocity) is a group of skips and tricks, grouped together to form what the Halo 4 community refers as Dawn Skip. This trick involves breaking out of the in-bounds map geometry through holes in the geo, dropping down to the bottom of the outside section where we would normally release the missile, and completing the escape of the Dawn Ship Explosion while on top of the hallways. Due to the nature of this trick, it will be broken up into the following sections:

- Dawn Skip Methods
- Fall Methods
- Final Escape Hall Platforming

This trick is considered beginner friendly; however, it is understandable that some runners would wish to complete the level 100% in-bounds. The in-bounds route explanation will be linked below the Dawn Skip categories.

### Dawn Skip 2022 Method

This is the current suggested method of getting out-of-bounds for most runners. A video tutorial courtesy of VyPr is available.

<youtube><https://youtu.be/y2XLlyo4nNU?si=DJASu_ccZa_5x8zo></youtube>

This method is quite difficult to explain through text, so it is highly recommended to refer to the video above. If you have difficulties with getting out-of-bounds, here are some recommendations:

- If you are bonking your head on the ceiling, you are moving too far backwards when jumping. You can solve this by angling more to the right when lining up for the nade throw, or hold S for a shorter period of time.
- If you are not getting enough height, you are jumping too early or too late. A good time to start moving is once the throwing animation finishes for the nade throw, while you are holding the Assault Rifle.

### Dawn Super Skip

Just like Dawn Skip 2022 Method, this is even more technical and is suggested to refer to the video tutorial from VyPr.

<youtube><https://youtu.be/R_5Ps1jWoic></youtube>

There will still be short overviews of each section below:

#### Out of Bounds Clip

This initial out-of-bounds was discovered by Harc when the Acrophobia skull was first added to the game.

For a quick technical explanation: every time you crouch and uncrouch while in the air, Master Chief's hitbox becomes slightly displaced. By performing a single crouch-uncrouch input at the apex of a jump—specifically at the pipe section—the top of Chief's hitbox is able to breach through to the other side. Since the player's camera is contained within this part of the hitbox, this allows the player to clip through and break to the other side.

Note: There is a relatively new corner cut right after the out-of-bounds, which you can see an [example of here.](https://youtu.be/t_dW56UbQcQ)

#### Elevator Climb

After hitting the elevator load, there are two options to ascend the elevator.

The first method (which is included in the trick tutorial above) is the recommended approach for full-game runs. Climbing the elevator is relatively simple, and the pressure launch method (detailed below) is inconsistent, making it difficult to recommend for full-game runs or new learners.

**Pressure Launch Method**: Discovered by Harc in August 2023, this method is highly inconsistent and behaves differently between controller and mouse & keyboard setups. As demonstrated in the [tutorial here](https://youtu.be/GikrlIBfjfY), even with a perfect lineup and input timing, you may achieve either too little or too much height. It is recommended not to attempt this method until reaching the sub-2:55 mark.

An updated tutorial with new information can be found below as well:

## Fall Methods

There are four current drop methods that are used for various reasons. For simplicity, all runners should start by learning the **Light Drop** method, as it is the most consistent and applicable for full game runs.

### Light Drop

The most consistent method, this involves jumping from the top of the Observation deck, landing on the light, then falling to the ground. It is rare to die from this method.

- [Light Drop guide by Cordiaxiz.](https://youtu.be/QjI6ruKl11I?feature=shared&t=753)

### Cordi Bounce

This is the optimal drop method when going for DSS (slightly faster method below but more difficult). By performing an edge bounce off of invisible geometry, chief's hitbox is able to be redirectly directly to the entrance of the escape hallways.

Note:Need an embedded image here.

- [Cordi Bounce guide by Cordiaxiz.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjI6ruKl11I&t=892s)

### VyPr's Refined Cordi Bounce

Same as before, but further optimized for DSS, and saves about a half a second. Recommended for top IL times.

- [Refined Bounce by VyPr](https://youtu.be/IREUxreoCKo?si=mPh-HYspDebQu0C4)

### Harc Fall

This is the optimal fall method for Dawn Skip (2022 Method). Using the same edge bounce technique, landing on a small rectangle geometry that's slightly elevated allows for a redirect without taking health or shield damage.

- [Harc Fall Tutorial by VyPr.](https://youtu.be/b09KOxxXg4s)

Note: There is a faster drop method for ILs, Danos Slip.

### Danos Slip

This is the fastest drop method for Dawn Skip (2022 Method), and is relatively inconsistent. Using the glass at the front of the Observation Deck, we sprint off at a very precise angle to hit the same geometry as from Harc Fall.

- [Danos Slip Tutorial by VyPr.](https://youtu.be/lBj0GwJqZ_Y)

## Escape Hallways

After a fall method is completed, the escape hallway load needs to be hit in a specific way to not end up in-bounds.

- Add embed image here.

Once the hallway is loaded, it is recommended to follow [this route](https://youtu.be/m-Y7gi8qVRo?si=8G2F9xKFOFMK_hfj&t=105) and follow the sprint cycles used in Harc's record run.

Note: If you have troubles with the double crouch jump after loading in the hallway, after the first crouch jump, look to the right and jump into the wall. This prevents the player from being pushed backwards. If you perform the Dawn Skip (2022 Method), you can also do a grenade jump here.

The final part of the platforming is the most difficult, and there is a separate [tutorial here.](https://youtu.be/EefXxwZLT00)

## In-Bounds Route

This route is outdated. Some runners may find value in running in-bounds if they enjoy the combat or find Dawn Skip to be too difficult.

- [Full Path Legendary Guide by Cory123](https://youtu.be/9E4035xJqjw?si=hzAWW_0S1jsK9T_5)

### Observation Deck

\- Easy Clear [Example](https://youtu.be/m4b_Jiu7ir8).

\- Legendary Clear [Example](https://youtu.be/cy8s2LoVS-U).

\- Note: <b>80%+ Plasma Pistol</b> - Used on Legendary, take a plasma pistol after 1st clear and swap it with an assault rifle. The plasma pistol wont despawn so u can take it after 2nd clear. [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b0m3tdr_n0)

### Outside Routes From Slowest to Fastest on Legendary

\- Junk Jump: (Without Concussion Rifle) Used mostly on the 360 version of Halo 4 because the concussion rifle is not easy to obtain. [Example](https://youtu.be/GvoX9QkDoG0).

\- Slower Concussion Jump: (With Concussion Rifle) Faster than junk jump, but is the slower than the concussion jump. [Example](https://youtu.be/ZkXjPFSV0qk).

\- Faster Concussion Jump: (With Concussion Rifle) Used on Legendary, very hard concussion jump, located next to the easy one. This one is very tricky, you need to use this [Setup](http://imgur.com/hMCJosi) and shots 4 times with ur concussion rifle. [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/9uF2vCXVtqM?t=5m23s)

## Potential Strategies and Knowledge Base

Throughout the development of this level, there have been many strat discoveries that have either been lost with time or have been proven too difficult to be executed consistently across runs.
