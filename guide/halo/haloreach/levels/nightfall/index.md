## Video Examples

Examples of every trick mentioned here can be found on either the [Individual Level](https://haloruns.com/leaderboards/reach/solo/nightfall/Easy) or the [Full Game](https://haloruns.com/leaderboards/reach/solo/fullgame/Easy) Records page. There are also multiple video tutorials for some specific tricks indicated on this page. Be sure to check \#reach-links in the Haloruns discord.

## Mission Start

Nightfall has a very simple route with quite a lot of important mechanics that will be used throughout the remainder of the full game run. These mechanics include: grenade jumps, slide jumps, and sprint cycle management. At the highest level, you will also be introduced to AI manipulations.

### 1st Grenade Jump

This first trick only saves about 1 second, and recommend that all runners learning this level learn this grenade jump.

Follow the linked video [here](https://youtu.be/xiHSMyERwuQ?si=wn6O-PDlwBWZIZrj&t=6), cut sprint while jumping and throw the grenade at about a 60-degree angle at the ground. Jump roughly around the time that the grenade blows up. Walk until your sprint fully fills back up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Rock Slide

There are two methods to do this slide. They are the same speed and difficulty, and would suggest trying both to see what method works best for you.

#### Boulder Edge Method

Follow the sprint cycles mentioned in this \[tutorial\]. You will want to start sprinting once you crest the hill and are on the flat ground. Once you pass the bush on the ground, jump on the rock in front of you. Once you take a single step, jump straight forward. You will want to hit the very edge of the large boulder to get an edge slide, making sure to cancel sprint and crouch to not overshoot the rock. Jump and uncrouch as you hit the edge.

#### Flat Rock Method

Same as the [boulder method](#Boulder_Edge_Method), jump at the bush and take one step on the rock, however, there is no need to cut sprint for this slide. Simply \[aim here\] while in sprint, and jump once you hit the rock. If you are overshooting the rock and hitting the ground, take a half step instead of a full step after you jump past the bush.

### 2nd Grenade Jump

Approaching the building after the slide, there will be a large boulder in front of you to the left. The boulder will be slanted at a 45-degree angle. Throw a grenade as you jump on the rock straight on so the grenade bounces forwards, and as you get to the top of the rock, sprint and jump towards the edge of the building in front of you. Crouch as you land on the roof.

  
You can walk a tutorial on the jump \[here\].

## Guta Area

This area includes the Guta monsters, the militia fight, and the alleyway to the final firefight. This segment of the run is where major time save can occur. Strats that are not necessary for beginners will be marked appropriately.

### Guta Boost

The Gutas have a strong melee that can boost a player or enemy in any direction. For the Guta boost, we want to be hit by the guta and sent towards the cave opening to progress the level.

  
To get the Guta's attention, shoot a sniper shot into it. Continue to shoot the guta with magnum shots. When the guta is about to scream, run behind it, and jump when it melees. You will be sent in the correct directions, which you can see \[here\].

### Blazit Launch

- World Class/IL Record Strategy

This is an optimization to the [Guta Boost](#Guta_Boost), but is quite a bit more difficult. You will want to delay the sniper shot much longer than the Guta boost, and shoot the Guta 3 times with the sniper total. For the timing of the jump, watch \[this video\] for examples.

The following slides are difficult to explain accurately and effectively through text, so video tutorials and examples will be linked instead.

### Additional Slides

#### Post Militia Slide

#### Pre-Firefight Slide

Example:

## Firefight

This section of the run is the major differentiator between top level runs and intermediate times. Being able to perform the following strategies first try will greatly reduce your time on the level, and will move you quickly into intermediate/world class territory.

- Note: APL is quite difficult, it is not recommended to go for this strat until you have mastered the other strategies in this guide.

### Forklift clip

There is a gap in the gate that by using the forklift in the correct position allows for the player to clip to the other side of the gate. This allows for the player to skip the entirety of the firefight sequence. There are two set up methods for clipping the gate with the forklift.

#### Yolo Clip

- World Class Strategy

This is the fastest method of forklift clip. Once you get inside the forklift, aim your reticle at \[this location\]. Once you get to the edge of the concrete by the door, turn to be parallel, flat against the gate. Get out and you will clip through. If you fail the clip, refer to the line up for [consistent clip](#Consistent_Clip).

#### Consistent Clip

- Beginner/Intermediate Strategy

Same entry as the [yolo clip](#Yolo_Clip), however before you exit the forklift, line up with \[the second grate line\] on the ground with the tip of the forklift forks. Once this is lined up, exit the forklift and you will clip through. If you fail, try again and adjust the line up slightly. Refer to the image on the right for the correct line up.

### Jun APL

- IL Record Strategy

#### Gate Jump

This is a backup method for [the APL](#Jun_APL) if you launch past the forklift but not over the gate. Follow \[this route\], throw the grenade at your feet, and perform a curve jump right as the grenade is about to go off. Proceed with grabbing the sprint as usual.

## Potential Strategies and Knowledge Base

Throughout the development of this level, there have been many strat discoveries that have either been lost with time or have been proven too difficult to be executed consistently across runs. The following sections is for maintaining a list of potential developments that may be referenced for a future date, and will be listed with:
