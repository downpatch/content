**Lone Wolf** is the final playable level in Halo: Reach and is considered a post-credits mission, following the Thank You message from Bungie. Due to its placement after the conclusion of the main story, it is not considered part of the game's official completion time for speedrun purposes. As such, it has no individual level entry (IL) on [HaloRuns](http://haloruns.com).

In Lone Wolf, players take on the role of Noble Six in a final stand against overwhelming Covenant forces, with the mission ending once the player’s character is killed. The fastest strategy for this level, particularly in speedrunning contexts, is to deliberately die as quickly as possible. Since the mission serves as a symbolic epilogue and the conclusion of the story, it is not counted in the Halo: Reach full-game speedrun times.

This level is unique in that its sole objective is to survive for as long as possible, but given the nature of speedrunning, the fastest method is to rush to death rather than attempt to survive. However, some players have attempted to survive for as long as possible on Lone Wolf. The current record for surviving in this level, played on Legendary difficulty, is over 100 hours long, though this is not recognized in the main speedrunning community as it does not align with the speedrun ethos of completing the game as fast as possible.
