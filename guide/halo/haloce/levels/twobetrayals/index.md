## Video Examples

Examples of every trick mentioned here can be found on either the [Individual Records](http://haloruns.com/records?lb=108) page or [Full Game Records](http://haloruns.com/records?lb=100) page. A comprehensive (75 minute long) tutorial by scurty of this level on legendary is located here: <http://www.twitch.tv/scurty_/c/5246784>

## Control Room

There are 4 Sentinels that immediately engage you after you skip the cutscene. You can ignore them on Easy.

### *On legendary*

Hide behind the thin glass to your right, fire a charged shot at each Sentinel. You can also aggro them without seeking cover. If you want to preserve PP battery, which could make subsequent fighting more easier, fire a charged shot at only 2 Sentinels and plasma pepper the others.

## Control Room Hall

### *On legendary*

Generally best to hang back and let the Sentinels and Covies fight each other. Keep in mind if most of the Grunts die, there will be an Elite and two Jackal reinforcements spawning in the back of the room. Kill some of the Sentinels and prioritize the very first Elite to prevent this.

## Control Room Entrance

### *On easy*

Get to the bottom of the ziggurat as quickly as you can and take Banshee.

### *On legendary*

There are two methods available here. One method involves a deload trick, and the other is the normal way to play the level.

Information on the deload trick (which is far easier by comparison and actually faster) can be found here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da8IEfjr5KU>

The other method spawns all the enemies like normally happens. Two Elites typically spawn to the right after opening the door, throw a plasma at their location without being detected. Throw a frag to clear the rest of the outside enemies. Try to kill them as soon as possible.

Head to the right side of the ziggurat, toss a plasma at the patrolling Elite, toss a couple more plasmas at the 2 Elites below. Drop down onto the snow and hug the wall to the right. Get close to the Wraith without being detected and shotgun it. The Wraith can still hit you in close range so stay very close to it. Take the Banshee afterward.

## First Tough Room

### *On easy*

Nade jump up to the ledge.

### *On legendary*

Break glass window to the left, alert enemies and toss plasma to draw them away, frag jump up to ledge, rocket Grunts below, frag/rocket Jackals. Toss a plasma or two across the hall to kill the 2 Elites.

## Second Tough Room

### *On legendary*

Hide and wait for Flood to engage Covies, throw frag through the gap in the wall to draw out Elites and kill Grunts, fire rockets.

## Covie Bridge

Yolo?

## Hell Room

### *On legendary*

Plasma nade the AR Flood, frag the shotgun Flood, toss a plasma where the 2 Elites spawn but don't trigger them until the nade is about to explode. Wait for a bit so the other Flood in the room to retreat then make your way to the next hall. Frag the Flood there and try to get a CP before engaging the lone rocket Flood. Just run through the next room, use an explosive behind you to kill the Infection form spawns and pursuing Flood. If you don't get the CP, simply backtrack and hit the lz again and you might get it.

## Flood Bridge

Yolo?

## Ground Floor

Fire rocket to flip Ghost upright, drive to Banshee. On your way there, get the health pack and ammo if needed, at the bottom of the spiral path area near the overturned Hog. Take the Banshee to the second pulse generator.

## Second PG (Pulse Generator)

Chuck frags, fire rockets, shotgun Flood, get CP. Disable generator, chuck nades, fire rockets at reinforcement Flood.

## Tunnels

Pray.

## Banshee Clip

[To get the banshee through the broken door, here is Garish's video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-9Gbx6txOQ)

Ram the nose of the banshee at the top of the door into the ceiling. Then while holding forwards, turn slightly to the left and let the banshee drift to the crack in the door. Then once your banshee's right wing reaches the door, turn quickly to the left and up, then turn back up and right to get both the right wing and the nose to the right side of the door. Once you have done this, look down and right, then turn to the left side of the door and hold back, then turn to the right side again and hold forwards and the banshee should be through the door.

## Broken Door

There are two ways to getting a Ghost through the door. One involves a rocket launcher or grenades. Stick one wing of the Ghost through the door, then use explosives (again, frags or rockets) to knock it through. The other utilizes the Banshee. Drop the banshee off at the door, then backtrack to the Ghost. Bring it back and back it into the door's opening. Exit and jump back through to the Banshee and use it to push the Ghost through. One wing will clip through when you've succeeded.

Do not race across the bridge in this room. You have to trigger both flood spawns for the last chapter ("Final Run") to trigger. Move slowly with the Ghost across the bridge. You've done it right when the Infection Forms spawn on the bridge and the 2nd wave spawns behind them. Once through the tunnel, if the letterbox with "Final Run" appears, you're good to go.

## Final Run
