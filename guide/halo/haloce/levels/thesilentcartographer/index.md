## Getting the Warthog

As the level starts off and lets you out of the Pelican, immediately head left away from combat and run around the island. Soon you will see a warthog. Use a grenade to tip it upright and hop in, continuing around the island. Grenade is swag strats but also a bit faster, go for it regardless no negative effect.

### *On legendary*

You should pick up the overshield by the crates before you get in the Warthog. This will help you to survive until the door skip easier.

## Security Door Skip

Once you reach the main building, drive your warthog in and proceed towards the door. There are a few ways to prevent the door closing on you.

- You can warthog fling into the door before it closes.
- If you miss the fling, you can clip above the door. Park the Warthog parallel to and right up against the door. Enter/exit the vehicle and adjust its position until you clip out of bounds. You will know
- The last way to simply jam the Warthog into the door itself. You need to be centered on the door from the top of the ramp and drive, full speed, strait at it. The Hog will be stuffed halfway into the frame and you can exit out. If you use this strat, when on your way back up top, you'll have to re-enter the vehicle and exit again to get back outside.

If you did the skip, jump around the gold Elite. Fire your weapon as you walk onto the platform to skip the Shafted cutscene. Keep in mind you will not get a checkpoint if you skip the cutscene.

## Cartographer Drop

Fall off the back of the platform and crouch as you are about the hit to minimize damage, proceed down the ramp and jump off again hitting the over shield on landing to take no damage. If you jump, activate the console, and spam enter you will skip the cutscene here and keep your forward momentum

## Cartographer Cutscene Teleport (Co-Op Only)

One player positions themselves near the top platform, but does not activate the 'Shafted' cutscene yet. The other player falls from the third level ledge, by the two dead marines, to the normal ramped walkway below. From there fall onto the overshield below and kill the two elites near the console before activating it. Activate both the 'Shafted' and map room cutscenes at the same time. Both players may be teleported to the top of the platform if done perfect.

**If it looks like you have been teleported to the map room, do not revert. Instead just wait two to three seconds, before the screen fades white for a moment, teleporting you both to the top platform.**

## Ascent - Stick Stack

When doing the fall off the bridge, do not grab the overshield, and make sure you have six grenades. This includes the 4 frags you start out with and the 2 plasmas that you get from meleeing the sword elite.

Line yourself up with a part of the circle / half circle in the geometry on the ground and throw 6 grenades in succession. They should all land nearby the overshield at the same time as you grab the overshield and jump. You should reach the top with the dead marines, frag grenades, and health pack.

## Ascent - Nade Jump

Run past the elites and head straight, here is a harder grenade jump that will allow you to save a few seconds and grab a active cloak The more consistent path is to head right as you reach the room, and head up the ramp though it is slower

### *On legendary*

After activating the console, throw a frag down the hallway to get both elites attentions, then assassinate both of them.

The grenade jump to get the cloak is highly recommended, as you can skip almost all the remaining fights in this section.

## Ascent - Jackal Room

The next room has a small jumping skip, jump on top of the "boxes" in front of the door you exit and then jump to the left platform using a pillar as a stopping point for the second part of the jump

Proceed to run out and skip the gold sword elite on your way out, and continue to the surface and wait for pickup.

### *On legendary*

Once you leave, take the warthog back up the ramp, and drive out of the building off the metal deck. Then proceed around to the right and back up, this buys enough time for the pelican to come so you don't die.
