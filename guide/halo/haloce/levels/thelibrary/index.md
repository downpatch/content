## First Floor

### First Room Enemy Skip - No Flood Bump(Legendary Only)

Immediately at the start of the level, there is a technique to skip enemy spawns, making it trivial to run through the first area. To start, run up to 343GS floating in front of you so he triggers and moves forward, then use one of the several techniques for grenade jumping above the wall on your right, putting you in the inner ring of the first floor. Once over the wall, run to the closest door on your left and go through it to backtrack back to 343GS. Once you trigger him to move forward, turn around and proceed through the level as normal. There will be no enemies until after the first door. A Video of this strategy can be found in [Older runs, before flood bumping was found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp2DbHn1TEI).

### First Room Enemy Skip - Flood Bump(Legendary Only)

Instead of running up o 343, just instantly do the nade jump, then run to the first door on the left, draw out the plasma rifle flood, shoot him only once in the arm, then run to the 1st door. Once you're near the door, go to the wall directly to the left of the door: <img here of that place>, get flush, then hold right strafe, and stop when you get here: \<img of that 2\>. Then, wait for the flood to melee you, then get behind it, wait for it to turn and immediately shoot it twice. If this was done right, stand on his chest, and when he revives you will be in the door. Jump through and go to the right and continue.

## Second Floor

### First Locked Door Enemy Skip (Legendary Only)

It is possible to halt the spawning of enemies at the first locked door on the second floor, saving you from 45 seconds of fighting in front of the door while it opens. Simply walk towards the door until the objective text "Wait here for the Monitor to open the door" shows up on your HUD, then walk back to the wall with the blue glowing panels on it. While standing there, no enemies will spawn other than a small amount of carrier forms. Wait in this position for ~35 seconds and then proceed towards the door; it should open as you arrive.

### First Locked Door Carrier Bump

Highly not recommended trick, since it has a low chance of success rate since it seems random the amount of success the trick takes to accomplish. To skip waiting for the door, you can toss a grenade at the carrier opposite the door and launch it towards the door. The carrier should then hit the door. While it is flying towards the door, position yourself with a shotgun such that your shotgun reticle is over the bottom part of the right leg of the carrier flood. Once it explodes, you will either have nothing happen which is what normally happens, or you will teleport into the door or past the door. If you are inside the door, you can proceed on by maneuvering yourself through the door depending on where you got bumped. If you teleport past the door, you have a possibility of making the next door not able to open unless you touch the door you just passed, but usually this doesn't happen.

### First Locked Door Flood Bump (Easy Only)

Once you exit the elevator, you must despawn the sentinels. This requires you to do a grenade jump such that you jump over a thick darker line on the floor right as you turn left to exit. If you fail to despawn the sentinels, stand on one of the ramps and shoot each of them down with the shotgun. Once you reach the door, look for human flood. Position your self against the door such that you are lined up with some horizontal geometry next to the door and you are towards the far back of the room. This will make it such that you are close to but not touching the door. Once your selected human flood reaches you and melees you, go around the other side of it and shoot it in the chest once. If it falls down, stand on top of its chest and wait to get bumped inside the door. If the human flood falls such that the dark line of the door intersects between the shoulders and the torso of the flood, you should be able to bump inside the door. Then maneuver yourself through the door by jumping. When bumping through this door, the next door which you grenade jump through opens earlier.

### Inner Ring Faster Route/Enemy Skip

Immediately after the first locked door on this floor, do not turn right as you normally would. Continue straight towards the center of the level. Get to the edge of the dropoff and hop along the inner ring to your right. This path is not only faster than walking the normal way around the outer ring, but it also despawns many of the enemies in that area, making it optimal for all difficulties.

### Second Locked Door Grenade Jump

The second locked door on this floor opens halfway and then stops for a time. Once it starts to open, a basic grenade jump will let you hop through the opening, allowing you to proceed without waiting for it to open fully.

## Third Floor

### Dark Door

Before you reach this door, make sure you delay a checkpoint just before the door. This is done by making sure not all of the enemies not including popcorn flood are dead in the tunnel before, but if they all are, make sure you keep jumping to delay it. Then throw a plasma at the end of the hallway just before the door. Once it explodes, you should get a checkpoint.

### Legendary

There are three flood lined up horizontally against the door. Throw a grenade either to the far right side of the door or in between the farthest two flood at the right. Then shoot your pistol at the door and shoot the farthest left flood in the chest twice such that its body will fall perpendicularly to the door, note that the flood falls at a slight angle when it dies. If it is a reviver, stand on top of the dot on its body right up against the door. If done correctly, you will get bumped into the door. Then jump through the door. If it isn't a reviver, revert to last checkpoint and try again.

### Easy

There are two flood lined up horizontally against the door. Throw a grenade at the far right side of the door. Then you have two scenarios. If the other flood is at the left side of the door shoot at the door then shoot once the flood once at the chest. Use the same line ups as the one on legendary. If the flood is at the center of the door, circle around to the right side of the door and line up with the flood such that the center of the flood's body is with the long vertical line at the left corner of the door closest to where you enter. Make sure you are not too close to the flood or it will go to melee you. Then shoot the door once then shoot the flood after it turns towards you. Stand on the flood's shoulder which is against the door. If done correctly, you will bump through the door. If the flood is not a reviver, revert to last checkpoint and try again.

### 60/90 Second Door

Before reaching the door, you want to shoot to attract the flood. Make sure you kill all the carrier flood before reaching the door. Walk to the health pack and grenades and you should get a checkpoint if no flood are directly behind you. Then turn around and check the human flood to see if they are revivers. Once you find one, revert to last checkpoint and make that flood follow you into the room and kill the rest of the flood around it by the use of a frag grenade or shotgun. Then line up against the door on one of the horizontal textures on the floor. Once the flood melees you, walk around to the other side of it and shoot it once or twice depending on if it is on easy or legendary respectively. Once it revives, you should bump through the door.

## Fourth Floor

### Tunnel Skip Grenade Jump

Near the beginning of the fourth floor you will encounter a half-open door and a lower tunnel which is the normal path. But it is possible to grenade jump through this half-open door into the next room, saving the extra walking.

### Final Door Grenade Jump

This is the toughest grenade jump in the level but is incredibly worthwhile as it skips the huge final battle of the level. The final door opens halfway, pauses for about 1 second, then resumes opening. A few seconds after this, a wave of 10+ flood spawn on the other side of the door. By timing a grenade jump to get through the door during the 1 second pause, you can hop through the opening before the flood wave spawns. Running straight to the end of the level should allow you to escape without dying on any difficulty.
