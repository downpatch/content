## Flood Bump

### Easy

To get a consistent reviver, hit restart level and hit enter on the prompt when it says "Are you sure you want to restart the level?" hit OK, Forwards, and Melee and Enter. Then once you release enter, keep holding forwards. You will then end up meleeing on the first frame an the flood will be a reviver. Then only hold forwards until you get past the door. Kill the grunt and lead the reviver all the way to the start of the level, line up against the wall on the sixth line and shoot the top right side of the reviver with the Assault Rifle until it falls over. Then crouch against the wall and wait for it to revive. If done correctly, you will be at the other side in the hallway near the exit.

### Legendary

[Here is a video of Joshington performing the trick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0FKPmvLGGA) To get a consistent reviver, hit restart level and hit enter on the prompt when it says "Are you sure you want to restart the level?" hit OK, Forwards, and Enter. Then once you release enter, keep holding forwards. Then only hold forwards until you get past the door. Kill the grunt and lead the reviver all the way to the start of the level, line up against the wall on the circle between the fifth and sixth lines and overcharge the flood near a dark spot towards the right side of its body. Then crouch against the wall and wait for it to revive. If done correctly, you will be at the other side in the hallway near the exit.

## Shield Bump

{{#Widget:YouTube\|id=hdKu1yFw9so\|right\|caption=Positioning on Xbox. (scurty)}} {{#Widget:YouTube\|id=sLm9EHSUBkc\|right\|caption=Positioning on PC, 4:3 ratio. (scurty)}} {{#Widget:YouTube\|id=UwH84meH_F0\|right\|caption=Positioning and bridge on CEA. (Dark)}} The Keyes shield bump allows you to go out-of-bounds and go directly to the bridge. This skips the entire sequence where you jump out of the ship, fight your way back up to the gravity lift, and get back aboard.

To perform the shield bump, zap the first shield generator in the level, then position yourself on top of it in exactly the right spot. When the shield reforms, you will be pushed above the level, out of bounds. Then you can walk backwards to the bridge, drop in, hit a load trigger to load the enemies, walk back and start the bridge cutscene.

The positioning is different between Xbox and PC, and on PC, it differs depending on your aspect ratio. Jumping and airstrafing allows for finer positioning than walking. Shooting the shield generator gives you more time to position yourself. There is about 3-4 pixels of leeway, making this one of the most precise tricks in the series.

### *On legendary*

After the shield bump, make sure to grenade the enemy groups to avoid dying in the cutscene / on your way out.
